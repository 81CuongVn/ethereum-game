## Crypto Kitties
"In CryptoKitties, users collect and breed oh-so-adorable creatures that we call CryptoKitties! Each kitty has a unique genome that defines its appearance and traits. Players can breed their kitties to create new furry friends and unlock rare cattributes."

## Ether Rockets
"Rockets are functionable and collectible digital assets that EtherRockets is centered on. You can obtain rockets in one of two ways - buying from the store or from other players on the marketplace. Rockets purchased on the store have a variable range of stats. For example, the starter rocket has a range of 16,000-18,000 for its "top speed" stat and is only discover-able after you purchase the rocket. This results in over 100,000 unique combinations of rockets for each type."

CryptoPets are digital critters that are one-of-a-kind and one hundred percent owned by you; they cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed. Will feature an interactive ecosystem of mini games and districts for our pets to feed, breed, and compete."

## Ether Craft

## Etherization
"Etherization is a civilization like game on Ethereum blockchain, written in Solidity, due to gas limits per block split in 3 contracts. Players add or withdraw ether to their treasury; by playing well they can increase it and make profit. It is possible to increase treasury by capturing other players' cities or by developing their own cities and taking a cut in other players' actions through production buildings. Before making the next move, players have to wait a fixed period of time, currently set to 6 hours (18 seconds on test private-net).
There are 3 units types and 5 building types."
